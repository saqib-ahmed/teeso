Teeso is a guessing game in Urdu and English for kids. It is a single player game that aims to be fully resposive for all devices and screens.

Game is fully client-side with all data stored in the browser's local storage.

For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.
